### Step 1: Integrate Member System into Website

Yes, we have implemented Facebook Login in our pages. But there are more stories along with member system.

Complete following requests:

1. Build a `profile page` including picture, name, and email.
2. If user is signed in and start check out, take `access token` from Facebook Login procedure and send it to [Check Out API](https://github.com/AppWorks-School/API-Doc/tree/master/Stylish#order-check-out-api) for record.
