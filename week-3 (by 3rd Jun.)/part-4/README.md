# Week 3 Part 7

## Assignment

### Step 1: Visual Details

1. Add `loading animation` for network response waiting.
2. Use `regular expression` for input checking.
3. Add `Hover Effect` for better experience.
4. Optimize all visual details as possible as you can: font, border, padding, margin, color, size, and any other left behind.

### Step 2: Lint Tool

Integrate one lint tool into your development process. Solve related problems around that. `ESLint` is my quick suggestion.

### Step 3: Refactor Code

Basic principles: `high readibility, high cohesion and low coupling`.

1. Write comments.
2. Review naming.
3. Make code structure just fit what we really want.

### Step 4: Distribute Website

Try to distribute your website to `Firebase Hosting Service`. It's a good start and practice for future project.

### Step 5: Custom Domain (Optional)

Buy your domain in [Godaddy](https://www.godaddy.com/) and apply it.

### Step 6: Tracking Performance on Business Side

We can implement more Google Analytics features in our website:

1. Event Tracking and Timing Tracking.
2. eCommerce Tracking.

Refer to [GA Documentation](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/gtagjs/) for developer.

### Step 7: Page Speed Optimization

Try [Google Page Speed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/) and fix all the issues listed in testing result, as possible as you can.
