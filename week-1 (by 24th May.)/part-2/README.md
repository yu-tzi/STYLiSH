# Week 1 Part 5

## Assignment

### Step 1: Get Marketing Campaigns

Key visual section is for marketing activities, located in the top of the homepage. There will be many marketing campaigns at the same time, but we just show one at a time.

Connect to [Marketing Campaign API](https://github.com/AppWorks-School/API-Doc/tree/master/Stylish#marketing-campaigns-api) by AJAX for the links, stories and image paths.  

Build key visual section dynamically.  
If user click on one of them, send user to the corresponding link.

### Step 2: Slide Effect

Complete slide effect to show different campaigns for customers in the key visual section.  
We should change to next slide every 10 seconds automatically.
