# Week 2 Part 2

## Assignment

### Step 1: Take Parameter from Page URL

#### Description

Any link to product page should take an `id` parameter for specific product detail.

For example: `product.html?id=11` is a link to product page where `11` should be a valid product id.

#### What We Should Do?

JavaScript code in `product.html` should take `id` parameter, and then, make an AJAX call to RESTful API for product details.

#### So, find a way to take id parameter from page URL by JavaScript!
